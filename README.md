I stuggled my way through coding it but It has given me a better understanding of object oriented language. I learned about the 4 pillars of object oriented language.

4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programing
Abstraction: Allows us to hide complexity
Encapsulation: Hiding the details of how method works
Inheritance: Allows objects to inherit properties and functionality from other classesâ€™
Polymorphism: Something can take many different forms.
